Studies in category-based induction typically follow a paradigm introduced by Rips (1975), in which participants are asked to rate the strength of arguments of the form:

Zebras have sesamoid bones
Hippos have sesamoid bones
--------------------------
All mammals have sesamoid bones

The statements above the line indicate the premises of the argument, which are assumed to be true. The task is to assess the likelihood that the category below the line, the conclusion, has the property.

Sloman (1993; http://matt.colorado.edu/teaching/categories/s93.pdf) introduced the Feature-based induction model in an attempt to explain the mental phenomena related to this task.

FBIM3 is an implementation of the FBIM for MATLAB.
